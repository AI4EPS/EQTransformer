Description
-----------
**EQTransformer** is an AI-based earthquake signal detector and phase (P&S) picker based on a deep neural network with an attention mechanism. It has a hierarchical architecture specifically designed for earthquake signals. **EQTransformer** has been trained on global seismic data and can perform detection and arrival time picking simultaneously. In addition to the prediction probabilities, it also provides estimated model uncertainties.   
 
The ``EQTransformer`` python 3 package includes modules for downloading continuous seismic data, preprocessing, performing earthquake signal detection, and phase (P & S) picking using pre-trained models, building and testing new models, and performing a simple phase association.
