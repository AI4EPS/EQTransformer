Overview
=====================

EQTransformer is a `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ based library for earthquake signal detection and phase picking using an attentive deep-learning model.
The ``EQTransformer`` python 3 package includes modules for downloading continuous seismic data, preprocessing, performing earthquake signal detection and phase (P & S) picking using pre-trained models, building and testing new models, and performing a simple phase association.
